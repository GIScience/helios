> Heidelberg LiDAR Operations Simulator (HELIOS)

HELIOS is a software package for interactive real-time simulation and visualization of terrestrial, mobile and airborne laser scanning surveys written in Java. Official website: http://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/helios_en.html

## Install
The pre-built project is available [here](https://apps.citius.usc.es/share/f.php?h=1Rp6aU05&d=1). Note that for faster simulations **building the project is recommended**. 

To build the project, first install the dependencies, then compile the source code, and finally execute it.

### Requisites
- Oracle Java 1.8
- Maven 3

You can use ```java -version``` and ```mvn -v``` to check if you already have installed those in your computer.

#### Linux/Ubuntu:
They can be installed by:

```bash
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer maven
```
#### Windows:
In Windows is less straightforward:  
- Java JDK  
	1. Download the [Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and install it  
	2. Create the environment variable *JAVA_HOME* to point to the JDK folder  
	(e .g: *JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_151*)  
	3. Add to the *PATH* the value *%JAVA_HOME%\bin*  
- Maven  
	1. Download the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) binary zip  
	2. Unzip it and move it to the desired folder (e. g. *C:\apache-maven-3.5.2*)  
	3. Add to the *PATH* the bin folder inside (e. g. *C:\apache-maven-3.5.2\bin*)  

### Compilation

Download the source code from this web site or from git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GIScience/helios.git
```
Then inside the root folder simply execute:
```bash
mvn package
```

### Eclipse IDE

To add this project to Eclipse go to *File > Import > Existing Maven Projects* and select *helios* folder.  
You may also want to disable the spell checker: right click in the project > *Checkstyle > Deactivate Checkstyle*

## Usage

HELIOS supports both single-ray and full-waveform simulations. Currently the default mode is the full-waveform. The selection between this two methods is done in the source code when creating the detector object in [*XmlAssetsLoader.java*](src/main/java/de/uni_hd/giscience/helios/assetsloading/XmlAssetsLoader.java). 

### Input

The argument of the program is the survey XML file, also the 3D models of the scene pointed in the survey are needed. See [Wiki: Basic input data](https://github.com/GIScience/helios/wiki/Quick-start-guide#basic-input-data) for further details. 

### Execution

From the root folder run:

```bash
java -jar target/helios.jar <survey-file>
```
To run the example survey:

```bash
java -jar target/helios.jar data/surveys/demo/tls_arbaro_demo.xml 
```

To use the batch mode (no visualization):

```bash
java -jar target/helios.jar <survey-file> headless
```
### Output

Output files are generated inside *output/Survey Playback* folder.

* Point cloud: File named *legxxx_points.xyz* separated by spaces  where *xxx* is the leg number.  
Fields:  
X Y Z I ECHO_WIDTH RN NOR FWF_ID OBJ_ID  
Example:   
-4.615 15.979 2.179 4.0393 1.4317 1 1 214275 1
* Waveform: File named *legxxx_points.xyzfullwave.txt* separated by spaces  where *xxx* is the leg number.  
See [FWF.md](FWF.md) for further details.
